## 🚀 How to Contribute? (Step-by-Step Guide)

New to GitHub? No problem! Follow these exact steps to make your first contribution.

### Step 1: Get the Code (Fork & Clone)
1. Click the **Fork** button (top right corner of this page). This makes a copy of this project in *your* account.
2. Open your terminal (or Git Bash).
3. Type this command (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/python-beginner-zone.git
   ```
 * Go into the folder:
 ``` cd python-beginner-zone
 ```
Step 2: Create a Safe Space (Branch)
Never change the main code directly! Create a "branch" (a separate version) to work on.
git checkout -b my-new-feature

(You can name it anything, like add-calculator or update-name)
Step 3: Write Your Code 👨‍💻
Now do your magic! ✨
 * Create a new Python file in projects/beginner-projects/.
 * OR add your name to contributors/contributors.md.
 * OR improve an existing project.
Step 4: Save & Upload (The Important Part)
Once you are done coding, run these 3 commands one by one in your terminal:
 * Add your files to the stage:
```
   git add .
```
 * Save your changes (Commit):
```
   git commit -m "Added a new cool project"
```

 * Send to GitHub (Push):
```
   git push origin my-new-feature
```

Step 5: Make the Pull Request (PR) 🔄
 * Go to your repository on GitHub (in your browser).
 * You will see a big green button saying "Compare & pull request". Click it!
 * Write a short title describing what you did.
 * Click Create pull request.
🎉 What happens next?
 * Our Auto-merge Bot will check your code.
 * If everything is okay, it will automatically merge your code!
 * You will officially be an Open Source Contributor! 🥳
